First, boil enough water in a pot to cook the pasta in
While it's starting to boil, heat up a sauce pan and cook the onions and garlic in oil until it's translucent
Put the premade tomato sauce into the saucepan (or the tomatoes) and then wait for it to simmer
Put the pasta in the boiling water for a few minutes until it's fully cooked and there is no raw parts in the middle
When the pasta is cooked, mix it with the sauce together or serve it seperate
Enjoy!
